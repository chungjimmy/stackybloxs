##Due 04/08:
Prepare This Readme. 
//TODO

* Decide on the Idea.
	Inspired by Tetris, Stacker, and Mario Kart.<br>
	Tetris: falling blocks, clear blocks, get points<br>
	Stacker: if you miss lining up blocks with previous blocks, you lose<br>
	Mario Kart: ? rainbow item box<br>
	
	Stack the blocks and get the high score!
* Decide on the target platform(Mac/Android/IOS,etc).
	Android
* Discuss weekly scrum meeting times outside of class times. Can be remote meetings, but in-person meetings are highly recommended.
	Saturdays 12-2pm on campus.
* Decide who is going to be the manager for the Git Repo. 
	Stevie
* Write out the various milestones below in the following format "Requirement - person responsible."
* Example: "Prepare health manager and mechanism for all relevant players to have a health component - Omar" 
* Make sure you discuss the idea and milestones with me on the first day, or anytime you decide to pivot your project.
* You must have access to your target platform in order to build for it (ex: Must have an android phone for android projects, Must have a Daydream ready phone and controller for Daydream project. Tango device for a tango project. A nintendo switch dev kit for nintendo switch project.)
* Each of your team members must answer the following in your **scrum meetings**:
	1. What have I dont since our last meeting
	2. What I plan do to till the next meeting
	3. Are there any issues that the team can help me with.

##Notes

* Make sure to updated the meeting notes from the scrum meeting outside of class.
* When work is finished, and milestones completed, strikethrough the requirement line to show progress,  ~~such as this~~
* You have to write a completed by: for each strikethrough.
* Example: ~~"Prepare health manager and mechanism for all relavant players to have a health component - Omar"~~ Completed by John Doe.
* Your requirements and intended features may change during scrums. Make sure you update this Readme if that happens(I support active change in reqs).
* Make sure you attend class regularly and show me the completed requirements in class. I will be interviewing teams every Saturday for grading purposes.
* Individual grading criteria: Saturday interviews, github commits, eventual team review form.
* Group Grading criteria: The usual grading criterial at the end of the project.(Fun to play, no bugs, Good contextual art, other minor things).
* You have been allocated Git LFS storage space on GitHub. You must use it if you intend to upload large files.
